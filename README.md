## Project introduction
<details>
  <summary>Motivation</summary>

  * Greenland's tidewater glaciers are a major source of sediment and fresh water to fjord systems.
  * This sediment supply delivers nutrients to fjord ecosystems, influences global and regional biogeochemical cycles, alters the morphology of Greenland’s fjords and coastlines, and provides vital natural resources.
  * Beneath glaciers, eroded sediment is either transported by meltwater, entering the fjord as a plume or as bed load, or by basal ice layers, entering the fjord as ice-rafted debris.
  * Currently, we have very few constraints on Greenland’s modern ice-rafted debris budget, much less the capability to predict how it may change under a warming climate.

  <summary>Description</summary>

  In this work, we:
  1. Present a dataset of over 100 observed debris-rich icebergs,
  2. Implement a physic-based model to predict the amount of sediment entering a fjord from iceberg calving, and
  3. Deliver a comprehensive estimate of the total flux of ice-rafted debris at three major fjord systems.
